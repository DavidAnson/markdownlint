# MD037 - Spaces inside emphasis markers

Tags: whitespace, emphasis

Aliases: no-space-in-emphasis

This rule is triggered when emphasis markers (bold, italic) are used, but they
have spaces between the markers and the text:

    Here is some ** bold ** text.

    Here is some * italic * text.

    Here is some more __ bold __ text.

    Here is some more _ italic _ text.

To fix this, remove the spaces around the emphasis markers:

    Here is some **bold** text.

    Here is some *italic* text.

    Here is some more __bold__ text.

    Here is some more _italic_ text.

Rationale: Emphasis is only parsed as such when the asterisks/underscores
aren't completely surrounded by spaces. This rule attempts to detect where
they were surrounded by spaces, but it appears that emphasized text was
intended by the author.
