# MD031 - Fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank lines

Tags: code, blank_lines

Aliases: blanks-around-fences

This rule is triggered when fenced code blocks are either not preceded or not
followed by a blank line:

    Some text
    ```
    Code block
    ```

    ```
    Another code block
    ```
    Some more text

To fix this, ensure that all fenced code blocks have a blank line both before
and after (except where the block is at the beginning or end of the document):

    Some text

    ```
    Code block
    ```

    ```
    Another code block
    ```

    Some more text

Rationale: Aside from aesthetic reasons, some parsers, including kramdown, will
not parse fenced code blocks that don't have blank lines before and after them.
