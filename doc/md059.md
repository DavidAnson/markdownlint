This rule is triggered when a link is set with a generic text like "Click here", "here", or "learn more".

Rationale: Screen reader users may navigate through a list of links on a page to quickly find content. When the link name is something generic like "Learn more", there lacks context to help the user determine whether to follow the link.

Link names should be descriptive and describe the purpose of the link.

Note: For now, this rule only flags against inline markdown links given the complexities of determining the accessible name of an HTML anchor tag.
