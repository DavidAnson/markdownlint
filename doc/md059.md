This rule is triggered when a link is set with a generic text like "Click here", "here", or "learn more".

Rationale: Screen reader users can navigate through a list of links on a page to quickly find content. However, when link text is generic, it becomes difficult to know whether to follow the link.

Note: For now, this rule only flags inline markdown implementation of links given the complexities of determining the accessible name of an HTML anchor tag.
