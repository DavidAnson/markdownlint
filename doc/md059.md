# `MD059` - Link text should be descriptive

Tags: `accessibility`, `links`

Aliases: `descriptive-link-text`

Parameters:

- `banned_link_texts_override`: List of banned link texts (`string[]`, default
  `[]`)

This rule is triggered when a link is set with non-descriptive text like
"Click here", "here", or "learn more", giving it a generic accessible name.

Rationale: Screen reader users may navigate through a list of links
to quickly find content on a page. When the link name is something ambiguous
like "Learn more", there isn't sufficient context to help the user determine
whether to follow the link.

Link names should be descriptive and describe the purpose of the link.

To override the default list and configure your own list of banned accessible
names, set `banned_link_texts_override` in the config.

Note: At this time, this rule only checks against inline Markdown links given
the complexities of determining the accessible name of an HTML anchor tag.
