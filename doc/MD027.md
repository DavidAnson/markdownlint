# MD027 - Multiple spaces after blockquote symbol

Tags: blockquote, whitespace, indentation

Aliases: no-multiple-space-blockquote

This rule is triggered when blockquotes have more than one space after the
blockquote (`>`) symbol:

    >  This is a block quote with bad indentation
    >  there should only be one.

To fix, remove any extraneous space:

    > This is a blockquote with correct
    > indentation.
