# MD004 - Unordered list style

Tags: bullet, ul

Aliases: ul-style

Parameters: style ("consistent", "asterisk", "plus", "dash", "sublist"; default
"consistent")

This rule is triggered when the symbols used in the document for unordered
list items do not match the configured unordered list style:

    * Item 1
    + Item 2
    - Item 3

To fix this issue, use the configured style for list items throughout the
document:

    * Item 1
    * Item 2
    * Item 3

The configured list style can be a specific symbol to use (asterisk, plus, dash),
can require that usage be consistent within the document, or can require that each
sublist have a consistent symbol that is different from its parent list.

For example, the following is valid for the `sublist` style because the outer-most
indent uses asterisk, the middle indent uses plus, and the inner-most indent uses dash:

    * Item 1
      + Item 2
        - Item 3
      + Item 4
    * Item 4
      + Item 5
