# MD038 - Spaces inside code span elements

Tags: whitespace, code

Aliases: no-space-in-code

This rule is triggered on code span elements that have spaces right inside the
backticks:

    ` some text `

    `some text `

    ` some text`

To fix this, remove the spaces inside the codespan markers:

    `some text`

Note: A single leading or trailing space is allowed if used to separate codespan
markers from an embedded backtick:

    `` ` embedded backtick``
