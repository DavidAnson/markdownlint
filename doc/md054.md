# `MD054` - Link and image style

Tags: `images`, `links`

Aliases: `link-image-style`

Parameters:

- `style`: Link or image style should be consistent (`string`, default `mixed`,
  values `consistent` / `inline` / `mixed` / `reference`)

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

Links and images in Markdown can provide the link destination or image source
at the time of use or can use a label to reference a definition elsewhere in
the document. The latter reference format is convenient for keeping paragraph
text clutter-free and makes it easy to reuse the same URL in multiple places.

This rule can be used to enforce a link or image style for the document that:

- `inline`: provides the link destination or image source at the time of use
- `reference`: defines the link destination or image source elsewhere to be
  referenced by label
- or `consistent`: Requires the same style be used everywhere in the document
