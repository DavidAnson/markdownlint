# `MD054` - Link and image style

Tags: `images`, `links`

Aliases: `link-image-style`

Parameters:

- `style`: Link or image style should be consistent (`string`, default
  `consistent`, values `consistent` / `inline` / `reference`)

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

Links and images in Markdown can provide the link destination or image source
at the time of use or can define it elsewhere and use a label for reference.
The reference format is convenient for keeping paragraph text clutter-free
and makes it easy to reuse the same URL in multiple places.

This rule can be used to enforce a link or image style that is either:

- provides the link destination or image source at the time of use (`inline`)
- defines the link destination or image source elsewhere to be referenced by
  label (`reference`)
- or `consistent`: `inline` or `reference` can be used but the whole document
  must use the same style throughout
