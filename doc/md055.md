# `MD055` - Table is missing leading or trailing pipe character

Tags: `table`

Aliases: `table-missing-border`

This rule is triggered when a [GFM table][gfm-table] is missing a leading
or trailing pipe character `|`.

This table is missing pipes on both sides:

```markdown
| Heading | Heading |
|---------|---------
  Cell    | Cell    |
```

To fix this, make sure there is a pipe character at the start and end of the
row:

```markdown
| Heading | Heading |
|---------|---------|
| Cell    | Cell    |
```

Note that text immediately below a table is treated as part of the table and
will trigger this rule:

```markdown
| Heading | Heading |
|---------|---------|
| Cell    | Cell    |
This text will trigger the rule
```

Rationale: Some parsers have difficulty with tables that are missing their
leading or trailing pipe characters.
