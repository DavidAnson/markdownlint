# MD002 - First header should be a top level header

Tags: headers

Aliases: first-header-h1

Parameters: level (number; default 1)

This rule is triggered when the first header in the document isn't a h1 header:

    ## This isn't a H1 header

    ### Another header

The first header in the document should be a h1 header:

    # Start with a H1 header

    ## Then use a H2 for subsections

Note: The `level` parameter can be used to change the top level (ex: to h2) in
cases where an h1 is added externally.
