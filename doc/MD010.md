# MD010 - Hard tabs

Tags: whitespace, hard_tab

Aliases: no-hard-tabs

Parameters: code_blocks (boolean; default true)

This rule is triggered by any lines that contain hard tab characters instead
of using spaces for indentation. To fix this, replace any hard tab characters
with spaces instead.

Example:

    Some text

    	* hard tab character used to indent the list item

Corrected example:

    Some text

        * Spaces used to indent the list item instead

You have the option to exclude this rule for code blocks. To do so, set the
`code_blocks` parameter to `false`. Code blocks are included by default since
handling of tabs by tools is often inconsistent (ex: using 4 vs. 8 spaces).
