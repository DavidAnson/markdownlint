# MD020 - No space inside hashes on closed atx style header

Tags: headers, atx_closed, spaces

Aliases: no-missing-space-closed-atx

This rule is triggered when spaces are missing inside the hash characters
in a closed atx style header:

    #Header 1#

    ##Header 2##

To fix this, separate the header text from the hash character by a single
space:

    # Header 1 #

    ## Header 2 ##

Note: this rule will fire if either side of the header is missing spaces.
