# MD041 - First line in file should be a top level header

Tags: headers

Aliases: first-line-h1

Parameters: level (number; default 1)

This rule is triggered when the first line in the file isn't a top level (h1)
header:

    This is a file without a header

To fix this, add a header to the top of your file:

    # File with header

    This is a file with a top level header

Note: The `level` parameter can be used to change the top level (ex: to h2) in
cases where an h1 is added externally.
