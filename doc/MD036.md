# MD036 - Emphasis used instead of a header

Tags: headers, emphasis

Aliases: no-emphasis-as-header

Parameters: punctuation (string; default ".,;:!?")

This check looks for instances where emphasized (i.e. bold or italic) text is
used to separate sections, where a header should be used instead:

    **My document**

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

    _Another section_

    Consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.

To fix this, use markdown headers instead of emphasized text to denote
sections:

    # My document

    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

    ## Another section

    Consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.

Note: this rule looks for single line paragraphs that consist entirely of
emphasized text.  It won't fire on emphasis used within regular text,
multi-line emphasized paragraphs, and paragraphs ending in punctuation.
Similarly to rule MD026, you can configure what characters are recognized as
punctuation.
