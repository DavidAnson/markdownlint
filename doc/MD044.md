# MD044 - Proper names should have the correct capitalization

Tags: spelling

Aliases: proper-names

Parameters: names, code_blocks (string array; default `null`, boolean; default `true`)

This rule is triggered when any of the strings in the `names` array do not have
the specified capitalization. It can be used to enforce a standard letter case
for the names of projects and products.

For example, the language "JavaScript" is usually written with both the 'J' and
'S' capitalized - though sometimes the 's' or 'j' appear in lower-case. To enforce
the proper capitalization, specify the desired letter case in the `names` array:

    [
        "JavaScript"
    ]

Set the `code_blocks` parameter to `false` to disable this rule for code blocks.
