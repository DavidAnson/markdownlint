# `MD012` - Multiple consecutive blank lines

Tags: `blank_lines`, `whitespace`

Aliases: `no-multiple-blanks`

Parameters:

- `maximum`: Consecutive blank lines (`integer`, default `1`)

Fixable: Some violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered when there are multiple consecutive blank lines in the
document:

```markdown
Some text here


Some more text here
```

To fix this, delete the offending lines:

```markdown
Some text here

Some more text here
```

Note: this rule will not be triggered if there are multiple consecutive blank
lines inside code blocks.

Note: Blank lines immediately adjacent to headings are not flagged by this
rule; the number of blank lines around headings is governed by
`MD022`/`blanks-around-headings`.

Note: The `maximum` parameter can be used to configure the maximum number of
consecutive blank lines.

Rationale: Except in a code block, blank lines serve no purpose and do not
affect the rendering of content.
