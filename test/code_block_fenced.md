# code_block_fenced

This is text.

    This is a {MD046}
    code block.

And here is more text

```text
This is a code block that won't trigger.
```

But we'll do another:

    And this {MD046}
    will.

Final text is here

<!-- markdownlint-configure-file {
  "code-block-style": {
    "style": "fenced"
  }
} -->
