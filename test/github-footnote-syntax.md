# GitHub Footnote Syntax

> Example from <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#footnotes>

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.

  "line-length": false
