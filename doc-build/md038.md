This rule is triggered for code spans that have content with spaces next to the
beginning or ending backticks:

```markdown
`some text `

` some text`
```

To fix this, remove any spaces at the beginning or ending:

```markdown
`some text`
```

Note: Code spans containing only spaces are allowed by the specification:

```markdown
` ` or `   `
```

Note: A single leading and trailing space is allowed by the specification and
automatically trimmed by the parser (in order to allow for code spans that embed
backticks):

```markdown
`` `backticks` ``
```

Note: A single leading or trailing space is allowed if used to separate code
span markers from an embedded backtick (though the space is not trimmed):

```markdown
`` ` embedded backtick``
```

Rationale: Violations of this rule are usually unintentional and may lead to
improperly-rendered content.
