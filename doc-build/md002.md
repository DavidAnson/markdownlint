This rule is intended to ensure document headings start at the top level and
is triggered when the first heading in the document isn't an h1 heading:

```markdown
## This isn't an H1 heading

### Another heading
```

The first heading in the document should be an h1 heading:

```markdown
# Start with an H1 heading

## Then use an H2 for subsections
```

Note: The `level` parameter can be used to change the top-level (ex: to h2) in
cases where an h1 is added externally.

Rationale: The top-level heading often acts as the title of a document. More
