> If `headings` is not provided, `headers` (deprecated) will be used.

This rule is triggered when there are lines that are longer than the
configured `line_length` (default: 80 characters). To fix this, split the line
up into multiple lines. To set a different maximum length for headings, use
`heading_line_length`. To set a different maximum length for code blocks, use
`code_block_line_length`

This rule has an exception when there is no whitespace beyond the configured
line length. This allows you to include items such as long URLs without being
forced to break them in the middle. To disable this exception, set the `strict`
parameter to `true` and an issue will be reported when any line is too long. To
warn for lines that are too long and could be fixed but allow long lines
without spaces, set the `stern` parameter to `true`.

For example (assuming normal behavior):

```markdown
IF THIS LINE IS THE MAXIMUM LENGTH
This line is okay because there are-no-spaces-beyond-that-length
And this line is a violation because there are
This-line-is-also-okay-because-there-are-no-spaces
```

In `strict` or `stern` modes, the two middle lines above are a violation. The
third line is a violation in `strict` mode but allowed in `stern` mode.

You have the option to exclude this rule for code blocks, tables, or headings.
To do so, set the `code_blocks`, `tables`, or `headings` parameter(s) to false.

Code blocks are included in this rule by default since it is often a
requirement for document readability, and tentatively compatible with code
rules. Still, some languages do not lend themselves to short lines.

Lines with link/image reference definitions are always exempted from this rule
(even in `strict` mode) because there is generally no way to split such lines
without breaking the URL.

Rationale: Extremely long lines can be difficult to work with in some editors.
